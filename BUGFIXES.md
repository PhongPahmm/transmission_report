# Bug Fixes Applied

This document lists all the bugs that were identified and fixed in the transmission application.

## 1. Java Naming Convention Violation

**Issue**: The getter method `getgLine()` in the `Complaint` entity class violated Java naming conventions.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/domain/Complaint.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/dto/Sheet5Mapping.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/dto/Sheet6Mapping.java`

**Fix**: Renamed `getgLine()` to `getGLine()` and updated all references.

## 2. Resource Management Issues

**Issue**: Improper resource cleanup in `ExcelTransferService.copyBlock()` method could lead to memory leaks.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ExcelTransferService.java`

**Fix**: 
- Added proper try-finally blocks for workbook cleanup
- Ensured workbooks are closed even if exceptions occur
- Added null checks before closing resources

## 3. Null Pointer Exception Vulnerabilities

**Issue**: Several methods didn't handle null values properly, potentially causing NullPointerExceptions.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ComplaintService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ExcelTransferService.java`

**Fix**:
- Added null checks in `insertDataToSheet()` method
- Improved `setCellValue()` method with better null handling
- Added validation for input parameters in `copyBlock()` method

## 4. Error Handling Improvements

**Issue**: Insufficient error handling and logging throughout the application.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/controller/ComplaintController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ComplaintService.java`
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ExcelTransferService.java`

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Improved error logging with detailed messages
- Added proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

## 5. Input Validation

**Issue**: Missing validation for method parameters could lead to runtime errors.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ExcelTransferService.java`

**Fix**:
- Added validation for source range and target start cell parameters
- Added range validation to ensure start position is before end position
- Added format validation for cell references

## 6. Database Configuration

**Issue**: Missing database connection pool configuration and logging settings.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/resources/application.properties`

**Fix**:
- Added HikariCP connection pool configuration
- Added proper Hibernate dialect for MariaDB
- Added comprehensive logging configuration
- Added SQL query logging for debugging

## 7. Temporary File Management

**Issue**: Temporary files might not be cleaned up properly in case of exceptions.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/controller/ComplaintController.java`

**Fix**:
- Moved temporary file cleanup to finally block
- Added proper error handling for file deletion
- Added logging for cleanup operations

## 8. Cell Copying Robustness

**Issue**: Cell copying operations could fail silently without proper error reporting.

**Files Affected**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/transmission/service/ExcelTransferService.java`

**Fix**:
- Added individual cell error handling
- Added cell copying statistics
- Added detailed logging for skipped cells
- Added error reporting for failed cell copies

## Testing

Added comprehensive unit tests to verify the fixes:
- `src/test/java/com/example/transmission/TransmissionApplicationTests.java`

## Summary

All identified bugs have been fixed with proper error handling, resource management, and input validation. The application should now be more robust and less prone to runtime errors.
